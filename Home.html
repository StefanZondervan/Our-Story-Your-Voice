      <h2>Our Story & Your Voice</h2>
      <p>This project is a storytelling platform built to navigate the complex heritage of the Port of Rotterdam. It's an educational journey designed to inform and familiarize you with a history that has long been overlooked, using the theoretical framework of Waldo Heilbron. But this isn't a history told by just one voice.</p>
      <p>This platform was made possible through the collaboration of many community members and leaders. We extend a special thanks to <strong>The Black Archives</strong>, which preserves Dutch Black heritage; <strong>SurinameOso</strong>, an organization dedicated to promoting Surinamese culture, education, and ethical tourism; and <strong>CTD.movement</strong>, a community group that empowers marginalized people to create. These organizations, each unique but all committed community builders, and the incredible people within them, shaped this platform and made it what it is today.</p>
      <p>Now, we're asking for your help to continue building this story.</p>
      
      <h3>Why share your heritage with us?</h3>
      <p><strong>Preserve Your Legacy:</strong> Your stories, photos, and memories are invaluable. By sharing them here, you ensure they become a permanent part of a community-driven archive, passed on for future generations to learn from and connect with.</p>
      <p><strong>Empower Your Community:</strong> This platform is a space for marginalized voices to be heard directly. Your contribution helps create a richer, more complete narrative of our shared heritage, moving beyond institutional accounts.</p>
      <p><strong>A Safe & Open Space:</strong> Your input is yours alone. We believe in open communication and a space free from harmful monitoring. We commit to a strict ethical framework that avoids reproducing harmful imagery or re-creating trauma. Our purpose is to inform, educate, and help communities move forward.</p>
  
      <h3>What happens to your story?</h3>
      <p>We treat every submission with respect and care. Your contribution will be a part of this open platform, presented as you wish, without harmful edits. We encourage you to reach out directly with any questions or concerns.</p>
  
      <h3>Ready to contribute?</h3>
      <p>This is an open invitation. If you have a story, a photo, or a piece of heritage youâ€™d like to share, we want to hear from you.</p>
